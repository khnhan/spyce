Description: This package analyzes survival data with outcome-dependent right-censored covariate. The semiparametric estimator SPYCE is implemented via `get_SPYCE_...` functions. This package provides other estimators for analyzing the same data: complete case estimator (CC), imputation estimator, inverse probability weighting estimator (IPW), and the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The estimated asymptotic variance for the estimators can be computed with corresponding `variance_...` functions. Conditional Kaplan-Meier estimator as an auxiliary tool for nonparametric estimators can also be implemented with this package.
